    My name is Lauren Capolongo and I am a senior at Syracuse University majoring in Information Management and Technology with a concentration in Digital Retail Strategies. I am passionate about my major because I have the ability to combine two subjects I am interested in: fashion and technology. Currently I am TAing for a class titled Social Media in Organizations. This summer I completed an internship for an entertainment company as a brand and partnerships intern and gained two new accounts for the company. My favorite TV shows are Big Mouth (on Netflix) and Rick and Morty (streamed on Adult Swim or Hulu). When I am home I competitively horseback ride and practically live at my barn but I would like to think I am not a “crazy horse girl.” My dream job would to be a product manager for an apparel company that designs equitation clothing. This would allow me to combine three passions: horses, fashion and technology.
