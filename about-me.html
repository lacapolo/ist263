        <h1>About Me -- Lauren</h1>
        <p>My name is Lauren Capolongo and I am a senior in the iSchool studying Information Management and Technology with a concentration in Digital Retail Strategies. I am interested in this course not only because it is a requirement but also I find it will be important towards my career to understand how websites are created. I look forward to the final project and combining my creativity and skills I have learned over the course of the semester.</p>
